The match participation functionality works correctly, allowing marking players as present, in the starting lineup, and setting their play time. While the debouncing for play time inputs is implemented in the code, testing showed that multiple API calls are still being made when typing rapidly, suggesting the debouncing implementation may need further optimization.

      message: "I've completed testing of the two recent improvements to the match system. First, I verified the simplified toggle buttons in the Match Manager. The 'Présent/Absent' toggle now uses a simple text-based design with '✓ Présent' (green background) when present and '✗ Absent' (gray background) when absent. The 'Titulaire/Remplaçant' toggle uses '★ Titulaire' (purple background) when a starter and '○ Remplaçant' (gray background) when a substitute. These simplified buttons are more stable and provide clearer visual feedback than the previous complex animated toggles. Second, I verified the separate U18/U21 averages in player reports. The match statistics section now shows 5 indicators instead of 4: (1) Matchs U18 joués (blue), (2) Matchs U21 joués (purple), (3) 5 de départ (green), (4) Moy. min U18 (orange), and (5) Moy. min U21 (red). This separation provides more detailed insights into a player's participation across different age categories. Both improvements are working correctly and enhance the usability of the application."

The implementation is clean and visually consistent with the rest of the application, using appropriate color coding for each indicator."
